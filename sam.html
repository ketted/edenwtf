            /> EDEN: sounds dope. what kind of shows will you be looking out for this semester?<br /> SAM: I actually have two in mind already: Run The Jewels are here in February and Vince Staples is here in March so I'm hoping to go to those,<br />
            and then any one else who decides to show up in Montreal and is dope <br /> EDEN: I heard you missed the KAYTRANADA concert and after party that everyone <br />gushed about last month; such a bummer. <br />Vince Staples would for sure lift your spriits!<br>who are some of your
            fashion icons? <br /> SAM: That is a very interesting question! I'm a big fan of Raf Simons and, of course, <br /> gotta shout out to my boy Yeezy, I actually just found a Yeezy Season 3 shirt in a Value Village <br />so I am excited about that<br
            /> Oh and I can't forget the fashion king himself: Greg Nip <br /> EDEN: facts. facts. glad to hear everything is going smoothly! wanna go for a rig?<br /> SAM : yes.<br /> EDEN: aight I am just gonna attach a pic, and link this on the index file <br /> SAM: skirt skirt</br /></h1>

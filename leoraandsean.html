        <h1>welcum 2 the website leora + sean!<br /></h1><h2>EDEN: How do you guys feel about love? Lust? <br />LEORA: You know, there’s just an innate need for feminine comfort. <br />EDEN: When do you think a boy becomes a man? <br />SEAN: Never. <br />LEORA: When he is financially independent… and when he stops talking to his mother. <br />SEAN: Family estrangement is not good!<br />EDEN: Wow!<br />LEORA: Anytime I meet a Jewish boy, I always check to see if we’re related before we kiss. It’s happened twice. I checked with you, Sean. <br />SEAN: There are actually a lot of South Africans Jews in Toronto.<br />LEORA: We’re everywhere. <br />EDEN: How are you feeling about majors? <br />LEORA: I have a joint honors, two majors and two minors. <br />EDEN: Those are, for sure, some big moves. <br />LEORA: Do you know those Air Head ads  where the balloon swells up and explodes? <br />EDEN: Is that you? <br />LEORA: *nods* <br />EDEN: For the record, that was a nod.<br />LEORA: Today, we walked by a lacrosse game and we both kind of stood there and tilted out heads to the side. <br />SEAN: It was really beautiful to watch. <br />

    <strong><h1>eric, welcome to eden.wtf <br /></h1><h2>EDEN: How do you feel about friends these days? High school friends? University friends?<br />ERIC: That is such a good question. Thank you for asking. I realized that because I am so far away from my high school friends there's nothing we can talk about, and when I talk about all of the good times I am having here, I don't mean it to, but it comes across as if I am bragging. <br /> EDEN: Well, you are having a rad time. With rad friends. Shoutout to the Boys! <br /> ERIC: Yeah, shoutout to the Boys. I love boys, man, I love boys. <br /> EDEN: Did you read the interview with Sam? <br /> ERIC: Of course. I love Sam. I love him for who he is because Sam is the type of boy who is comfortable in his own skin. I respect that.<br /> EDEN: Yeah I totally agree. He is dope. A genuine, sincere dude.<br />ERIC: Oh, and shoutout to Ethan, glad he is home! Shoutout to all the Boys; Slim Prism, Dara, all the Boys.<br />EDEN: Let's get Dara a passion.<br />ERIC: Dara speaks as if he has a lot of opinions about everything, but really has no concrete opinion. That is what makes him a cornversationalist.<br />Man, to wrap off, just live life. Try hard in school, but don't stress too much. Take it easy.<br />EDEN: Signing off. </strong>

                    <h1>EDEN: Want me to interview you? <br /> SAM: Yeah, that'd be so good. <br />Now you ask me questions. <br /> EDEN: Why do you smoke?<br/> SAM: Oh, brother. <br /> EDEN: Is that no comment? <br /> Oh, I'll interview you about music. What are you feeling lately? <br />            SAM: I've been listening to a lot of MF DOOM (all caps when you spell the man's name) lately,<br /> but not like his stuff under MF DOOM because I've already listened to it all,<br> but a lot of his stuff under aliases like King Geedorah or Viktor Vaughn<br
            /> EDEN: Sounds dope. What kind of shows will you be looking out for this semester?<br /> SAM: I actually have two in mind already: Run The Jewels are here in February<br /> and Vince Staples is here in March so I'm hoping to go to those,<br />
            and then any one else who decides to show up in Montreal and is dope. <br /> EDEN: I heard you missed the KAYTRANADA concert and after party that everyone <br />gushed about last month; such a bummer. <br />Vince Staples would for sure lift your spriits!<br>Who are some of your
            fashion icons? <br /> SAM: That is a very interesting question! I'm a big fan of Raf Simons and, of course, <br /> gotta shout out to my boy Yeezy, I actually just found a Yeezy Season 3 shirt in a Value Village <br />so I am excited about that.<br
            /> Oh, and I can't forget the fashion king himself: Greg Nip. <br /> EDEN: Facts. Facts. Glad to hear everything is going smoothly! Wanna go for a rig?<br /> SAM : Yes.<br /> EDEN: Aight, I am just gonna attach a pic, and link this on the index file. <br /> SAM: Skirt, skirt.</br /></h1>
